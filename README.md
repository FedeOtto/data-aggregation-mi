### Data
MPDS data used to reproduce the experiments can be obtained by using `retrieve_mpds.py` script, given that access to the API is provided. For more info visit https://mpds.io/developer/. Examples of data aggregation can still be reproduced using Materials Project (`mp`) and AFLOW (`aflow`) data assessed in this work.
